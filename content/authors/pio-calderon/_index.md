  I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Technology Sydney, supervised by Dr. Marian-Andrei Rizoiu. My research interests revolve around (1) modeling how information and influence bleed across different online platforms, and (2) how we can leverage these models in social media marketing.

  Prior to joining the Behavioral Data Science lab, I was a data scientist at the marketing AI startup Neuro Flash, where I helped brands optimize their marketing message and gain better insight on consumer understanding using a mix of NLP and image models. I also served as a data scientist and consultant at the fintech startup Ayannah, wherein I initiated efforts to leverage their transactional data (i.e. remittance  and airtime credits) to better understand the profile and usage patterns of their customer base.

  I usually spend my free time watching movies and playing long, story-driven Japanese RPGs. I'm also an avid traveler and love going on solo backpacking trips to explore new cultures. I'm constantly thinking about how I can applying data science tools to analyze popular media. When I have the time, I write about my travels and data experiments on my [blog](https://piocalderon.github.io/).
