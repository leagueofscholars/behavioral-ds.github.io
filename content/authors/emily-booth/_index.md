I am supervised by Dr Marian-Andrei Rizoiu, Prof Lexing Xie and Dr Stephen Wan. My current research focuses on modeling information diffusion in social media. Specifically, I am working on understanding the connection between epidemic models and self-exciting point processes and quantifying online diffusions with tools from the connection.
